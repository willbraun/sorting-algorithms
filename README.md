# Overview

I learn by doing, so I created a basic web page to learn and implement various sorting algorithms. It shows a random set of numbers between 0 and 100, and buttons to sort the numbers based on the following algorithms. 

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Counting Sort
- Radix Sort
- Bucket Sort

Numbers will rearrange and turn green once sorted. You can create a new set of numbers to sort using the New Set button.
